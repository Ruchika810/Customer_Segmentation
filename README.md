#🛍️ Customer Segmentation and Purchase Prediction

#📌 Objective
To perform customer segmentation using unsupervised learning and predict customer behavior using supervised learning techniques. The project aims to identify distinct customer groups and forecast their likelihood of purchase or churn, helping businesses create personalized marketing strategies.


#🔍 Project Overview
This project combines both clustering and predictive modeling:

Segmentation Phase: Customers are grouped based on behavioral and demographic features using clustering techniques.

Prediction Phase: A classification model is built to predict customer purchase intent based on their profile and past behavior.


#🧠 Approach
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed customer attributes: Age, Gender, Spending Score, Annual Income, Purchase Frequency, etc.

Identified patterns and outliers, handled missing data.

2. Customer Segmentation (Unsupervised Learning)
Applied K-Means Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering.

Determined optimal number of clusters using Elbow Method and Silhouette Score.

Visualized clusters using PCA and scatter plots.

3. Customer Prediction (Supervised Learning)
Built models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to predict:

Likelihood of repeat purchase

High/low spenders

Churn risk

Evaluated model using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.

4. Insights & Recommendations
Identified 4–5 key customer segments with distinct behaviors.

Suggested marketing strategies tailored to each segment.

Predicted high-risk churn customers for proactive engagement.


#✅ Key Achievements
Created distinct customer personas (e.g., High-Value Loyalists, Discount Seekers, One-Time Buyers).

Achieved X% prediction accuracy (replace with actual result).

Visualized clusters and model results for stakeholder clarity.

Developed reusable and scalable analysis pipeline in Python.

Clean and well-commented Jupyter Notebook included.
